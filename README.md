# Qt_Code

## Program Development Environment
WIN10<br>
CUDA 12.4  cudatoolkit 11.3.1<br>
onnxruntime 1.8.0  onnxruntime 1.12.0<br>
opencv-python 4.6.0.66<br>
pyqt5 5.15.6<br>
pytorch 1.11.0

## Project Description
After setting up the environment as described above, you need to unzip onnxruntime.zip into the downloaded Machine_Vision_and_Mask-RCNN_application folder for invocation. This ensures that the program can accurately locate the ONNX inference model of Mask R-CNN during execution and prevents Qt from encountering errors due to missing ONNX runtime files. For detailed program execution processes and results, please refer to the README file in the Machine_Vision_and_Mask-RCNN_application folder.<br>
Please modify the various paths involved in the program code according to your actual situation as needed.
