## Project Description
After configuring the environment as mentioned above, you need to extract onnxruntime.zip into the downloaded Machine_Vision_and_Mask-RCNN_application folder to ensure that the program can accurately locate the Mask R-CNN ONNX inference model during execution. For specific program execution processes and results, please refer to the readme file in the Machine_Vision_and_Mask-RCNN_application folder.
Please modify the various paths involved in the program code according to your actual situation as needed.
